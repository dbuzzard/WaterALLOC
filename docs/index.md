# Welcome to the WaterALLOC User Manual

## Introduction
### Water Allocation Tool Powered by HydroBID and MODSIM
The objective of this project is to develop a MODSIM-based Water Allocation Module (WaterALLOC) to be used in conjunction with the Hydro-BID modeling system, using the river basin simulation capabilities from MODSIM to enhance our river basin planning and management offerings.  The new module will allow using the hydrologic processes simulated in Hydro-BID and import them directly into MODSIM to perform simulation of water allocation and system operations, based on water use priorities, water rights, water permits, storage operation rules, and administrative and social constraints.  The new robust modeling platform will strengthen RTIâ€™s river basin management offerings, including streamlined data management between the models, ability to simulate responses and alternatives in complex systems, evaluate water availability including priorities and operations, and evaluate impacts of climate change and benefits of adaptation measures.
